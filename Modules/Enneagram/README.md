The Enneagram module provides personality type assessment and insights based on the Enneagram system, helping users understand their core motivations, fears, and growth paths.

## üìÅ Module Contents

### Core Files
- `README.md` - This overview document
- `Enneagram_Test_Plan.md` - Complete testing strategy

## Database Design

### Core Tables
- `enneagram_types` - Nine core types with descriptions
- `user_enneagram_profiles` - User's Enneagram type and wings
- `enneagram_assessments` - Assessment history

## Data Storage Patterns

### Type Information
- Static type descriptions cached in memory
- User type profiles stored with confidence scores
- Historical assessment data for type evolution tracking

### Relationship Dynamics
- Pre-computed compatibility matrices
- Cached interaction patterns
- Dynamic relationship insights

- `GET /api/enneagram/assessment/:id` - Get assessment results

### Type Information
- `GET /api/enneagram/types` - List all types
- `GET /api/enneagram/type/:number` - Get specific type details
- `GET /api/enneagram/user/:userId/type` - Get user's type

### Growth & Development
- `GET /api/enneagram/growth/:typeNumber` - Growth recommendations
- `GET /api/enneagram/stress/:typeNumber` - Stress patterns
- `POST /api/enneagram/journal` - Track growth journey

### Relationships
- `GET /api/enneagram/compatibility/:type1/:type2` - Type compatibility
- `GET /api/enneagram/team-dynamics` - Team type analysis
