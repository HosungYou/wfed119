## Notes

- The textbook’s “Work Values (직업 가치)” begin on PDF p.6 but continue beyond; they are not fully covered within pp.4–6. If needed, I can extract the next page(s) to translate the full work-values list as well.
- English labels align with the Info Sheet where available to keep terminology consistent across materials.
