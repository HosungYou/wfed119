 and age 65 or 66 would be very important because at that age I would be entitled to get maybe pension, retirement. So even if I retire from 10th date I would be able to maintain what I've been doing. If I want to work as a professor or teach I could or if I want to completely leave and do whole new thing then I can because it's highly likely that I will have income as long as I stay here working for 10th date. That's where I am. So for me I'm envisioning the future 10 years from now and comparing between envisioning 10 years from now or age 65 I think 65 would be more important to me. So yeah I need to think about what that would be like. I have a lot of many many different options but one thing that I wrote through this book I gave an example and that example was to start I think a company. So I may be a CEO, a over company what we see but providing a consulting or say maybe research based consulting. I can talk a bit more but so what's your ideal future and what's the time horizon that you are thinking of? Is it 10 years from now or 15 or 20 years? Can you decide? I think it's 10 years. 10 years? Yeah. So if the person doesn't have a specific time point in mind let's go with 10 years. But let's do not make 10 years a default option. So that's what I'm thinking. But then how would I organize the instructions as a first step? So first prompt to be if you if you have a idea of future that you want to envision through this exercise many is it? Yeah, when is it? And what are you doing? And if you cannot think of if you don't have that in mind that's envision your idea future 10 years from now something like that. But as far as understand this activities in the textbook was let's envision the timeline and like make a vivid situations. So like it started from those like those situation about like when someone wake up in the bedroom and they will go like they will give some vivid instructions about that's a day or yeah. I think that was kind of my intention of having that is so that's what we will do today. So that's kind of imagery. So it's kind of warm up warming up activity. So it's to get them think about future but it doesn't need to be translated into a vision statement. So what I want you'll see so if you follow the book. So there's so I asked students to people to start guide imagery and then brainstorm their dreams according to different life stages and life span or life space. I've stages and life space and then I asked them to write stories about their future past present future and then turn all those into a vision statement. So having all those but asking the question about what's the essence in the stories that they have envisioned. So through the guide imagery they will be imagining a particular time but through the dream list activity there will be brainstorming things that there will be accomplished or conferishing in the future considering different life roles and then that will be for the extended or expanded into life stories of all the future and then you are turning those all those into one phrase requires them or ask asking a question about what would be a symbolic moment or symbolic part of the story that you really want to achieve. So that's the vision statement component. So maybe the second step of our discover is to find what's the core aspiration points. So yeah yeah yeah yeah. So does instruction will be could you please share what you imagine for your idea of future try to be as specific as possible. What were you doing? How did you feel? What impact were you making? So by making those discourses with this AI he will retrieve four at least three to five core aspirations automatically. So those will be helpful to draft their vision. Yeah but for visual statement ideally it would be to extract one core component in the future. So it's um where if that core component can encompass some other things that can be really helpful. What the vision statement needs to be symbolic. So the question should be whether they receive the assumption should be that they already have developed a story about their future and you can ask them to copy and paste most important part of their future of their story and then they can paste it and then the AI can ask what's the essence of this story and how would you turn it into one short phrase making it highly motivational and symbolic and things like that. Yeah so the four steps of this AI activities will help you through those help you through to have one compact expression phrase. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah I'll try to refine it but what would be the today's activity? Like do I do it to use this one in this class? Maybe I think that this app is not ready to be used for today. But I think yeah let's work on it further. But once they have some stories and they let's say if they have the dream list and stories from a future moment and then they can put that info onto here then AI can ask a series of questions to identify what's the most important part in the future. So I wanted to experiment with people here I see I'll be recording to help our whosong to process. Recording in progress. So can anyone share your idea of your state? But I think first of all it could be more clear if we can or you can give us like specific themes. Like is it work related or is it our like yeah laser related? It should be I think about for this vision activity if we can make it relate to professional self. Yeah professional self. Yeah professional self that would be wonderful. So otherwise people would say oh nice big house in somewhere by the lake and so on so yeah make it professional self. Yeah. Yeah. I think like many of like individuals have their own future states and like we realized that's like girls in the class vision themselves like vividly in their future ages with their families with her families. If we don't really give those kind of instructions she will envision herself with her families. That's clear too. So what can what they may be prone to me missing is the professional element. So people can envision those personal or life components but that's very important from my balance or a working perspective but the professional self should should be the anchor in those parts and in this class. So can you for example like to help them think on that moment to get them like some questions like shorter questions to help them to think further? So that that will be done today so through guide imagery there will be series of questions narrations so it'll be a matter of doing something similar for different stages of their life. Yeah. Like for example I don't know if you're sitting in it's not a meditation but when some more just accident close your eyes. I think you're doing it. Yeah that will do it today. That's kind of imagery. So let me will use the same process. This is a long, long version just for if there's something like you would have to do. Yeah I need to find a shorter version. This one is Fatma did you follow the guided imagery when you volunteer in the DC area? Yes. Okay. I did it. Yeah. So yeah that was maybe a few years ago. Yeah. I didn't think that it would work. Yeah so this script that I'm sharing is for mid-life people. So I have another version for younger ones. So here I sit there comfortably in the answer chair. Play sports field, flat on the floor, technically close your eyes, breathing deeply, excess slowly and so on. And then so but looking back five years wouldn't be much valuable for this group. So we will not do this that will ask them to see. Even like when they are choosing their majors so maybe five years before now, and how they like how is their thinking when they want to choose their major? How what's helping to choose for example this university and this major and if they will continue on this major? What is their like thoughts? Yeah I need to think about that some students don't have their major at the moment. So yeah it's a bit complicated so but for or choose the university. Why they choose this university? For example what is their aim? What they want to be? Yeah that would be good. Yeah yeah having that component would be good. So we can modify some of these to yeah the college students. So here the script that I created for the midlife people was to envision a day five years from now. But in my previous script it was open to them. So it's up to them to decide whether it's five years or ten years. And so. You have like the student who are the parent here. Yeah. So what do I think? I think when they start thinking to apply to the high school for the university and they think they've been to university parks specifically. What were they thinking about? Yeah in many cases some students don't have much clue regarding what they want to do in the future. They have many of the students have vague ideas. But very few have concrete ideas. Anyway that's what I can experience in. Are we? Yeah good. Are we going to use all of these instructions in our activity like all class? No this is for midlife people. I have another proficient that can be college students for the shortened one. Yeah even though like my point was we may spend a lot of times if we go through all of the questions here. So like especially when we're doing like AI app. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I can't do it through this one. Yeah. We can ask them to write down the essence of what they envisioned or what they wrote and their future stories. But I think applying those like one of those each questions in the AI app might be helpful. Like we can use one of the questions in financial style stability is one of one of one of one of questions in the proposed and many. Yeah. To make a like visibility. Yeah for the vision statement version to have a very short phrase. I wouldn't put in because that in that mission I have vision statement. Different life rules cannot be considered because we are asking them about the professional self as for the vision statement and so it would be just them on be like oh I'll be a nice nice grandfather or generous grandfather or I will be a millionaire or billionaire. So that would be two. It's about certain dimension only. I'm thinking about using AI. I don't know there is a tool when you like have a picture of your face and see yourself when you are young and when you are growing until you become like elderly. So to give them this like 10 years how they were and how they are currently and after 10 years how they look like. So think about them self. How if this is a person that you are there. How you think yourself will be working in or doing at that time until you get older. By the way, there. Do you have to know the app? I know in snapshot there is a filter. Okay. But there is I think should you be able to do that if you get them the picture. Maybe. Your picture and ask yeah and then they put their image and each 10 years. Yeah. How they are looking look like. Considering like the vision statement is about to the professional career like from the experience. You can be a master career or anything. Because any work related activities will be career. Or business. Yeah. Creating something, having a business or taking a certain role. Yeah. So I'm not sure this activity will be helpful to retrieve some career related core aspirations term. What about those like past future of past current and the future stories to retrieve the core aspirations in their career. Yeah. So we can ask them to copy and paste their future stories. So they will have written past current and future stories. Because vision is about the future. We just need only need the future story for the AI. So we can ask them to copy and paste the future stories. And then AI can ask some questions. And also double check whether there is sufficient information about their professional self. Yeah. That's yeah that's what I thought. But if we can like connect those past and current with the future. So AI can help connecting those components with the future statement which is our our direction, our objective. The connecting anchor is the mission statement. And the professional self needs to be linked to the mission statement. And in many cases, the self is connected throughout their lives. It can be like the past cannot. Although if you don't do anything, the past can be a good prediction for your future. But in this class, the belief is that you can create your own desired future. So I have this course help students to crystallize who they are based on their past stories, life themes and so on. So life themes will stay through the future as well. So that maybe that's why you are saying the past will be connected. But that's connected through like themes. So if we can ask them to put in their life themes, their mission statement, that can be a good guide for the future. But somehow because I want them to intentionally create their idea of future, I don't want to interfere the future component by providing the stories of the past. But I just wanted to make a clear structure of their division statements module. I'm going to revise the structures after having this question here. Yeah, but I just wanted to like apply some of the components here. Is that some of the structures in this textbook or any already existing structures here? The canvas. As I mentioned, life themes and life values. Also values are likely to stay. They are important values and mission statement. And those can be one of the inputs and life stories, their future stories. So those will be input and we can go from there. So do you want me make users cannot proceed without having those results? So we already have the right values and the mission statement in our website. So do you want me to do it? So you can ask them to supply those. And if they already have written the life stories, including the future part, it can be life stories and dreams and so on. They can paste all those. Then AI can summarize those. But what AI should ask is, if you were to choose only one of these, only one, what would that be? And when is it? And then there will be the timeframe for the vision. And the AI should help the students to develop highly, I can say, attractive vision statement. So supplying mission, the stories and various life themes and so on would be the starting point to, and also the list of dreams. And it can be also the results of their guided imagery. So after the guided imagery, what I asked them to write down is, any of the scenes that they have envisioned, if they want to remember it for future career, I asked them to write it down. And if they can supply that in the app as well, that would also be a very helpful. And some of the questions I ask is the magnitude of impact or which of their influence. So whether they want to reach people in their country, or in their community, or it would be internationally, or how many and so on. So I asked them those questions when they come up with a vision statement. So those are some of the questions that they can ask. The AI can ask. I found this, but I don't know the talk. So they can put their picture and see in different ages how they would be. So that might be what happened to Imagine herself. So just one sec. So I need to think about how you would be able to use the image. And so I need to think about how you would be able to use this in class, if this is in class activity, but the song that gives to you. So I'm going to put it in the cup. I think it's like, maybe i typed the про, Uh, Charlotte? I just want to give it the same. I typed it the same but it doesn't come up. But it looks the same. So which one is the same? The one that I give to. This is one of them. Yeah, it doesn't come up that way. So I mean it test how it works if we want to use it. This is a bit... It looks like a bit of a... ...mocking thing. Why do you like it? It's so... Yeah, another thing to consider is the privacy. So some stills may feel uncomfortable putting that photo in. So look at you and the photo. You have to like, for example, the difference between the mission and vision. This is my big mistake for some. Yeah, I can explain. Yeah. Today we are able to guide the imagery and then trim this activity. Let's see. I will share my screen. So Dr. Yann, I will share the revised structure by following your current feedback with you. Let's start revising the structure after reviewing the documentation.

**[0.00s - 11.74s]**
 and age 65 or 66 would be very important because at that age I would be

**[11.74s - 22.02s]**
 entitled to get maybe pension, retirement. So even if I retire from 10th

**[22.02s - 30.84s]**
 date I would be able to maintain what I've been doing. If I want to work as a

**[30.84s - 39.90s]**
 professor or teach I could or if I want to completely leave and do whole new

**[39.90s - 47.02s]**
 thing then I can because it's highly likely that I will have income as long

**[47.02s - 60.22s]**
 as I stay here working for 10th date. That's where I am. So for me I'm

**[60.22s - 70.30s]**
 envisioning the future 10 years from now and comparing between envisioning 10

**[70.30s - 79.42s]**
 years from now or age 65 I think 65 would be more important to me. So yeah I need

**[79.42s - 85.80s]**
 to think about what that would be like. I have a lot of many many different

**[85.80s - 93.80s]**
 options but one thing that I wrote through this book I gave an example and

**[93.80s - 107.70s]**
 that example was to start I think a company. So I may be a CEO, a over company

**[107.70s - 117.74s]**
 what we see but providing a consulting or say maybe research based consulting.

**[117.74s - 126.92s]**
 I can talk a bit more but so what's your ideal future and what's the time

**[126.92s - 134.94s]**
 horizon that you are thinking of? Is it 10 years from now or 15 or 20 years?

**[134.94s - 138.94s]**
 Can you decide?

**[138.94s - 149.14s]**
 I think it's 10 years.

**[149.14s - 152.14s]**
 10 years?

**[152.14s - 160.44s]**
 Yeah. So if the person doesn't have a specific time point in mind let's go with 10

**[160.44s - 167.24s]**
 years. But let's do not make 10 years a default option. So that's what I'm

**[167.24s - 175.44s]**
 thinking. But then how would I organize the instructions as a first step?

**[175.44s - 191.94s]**
 So first prompt to be if you if you have a idea of future that you want to envision

**[191.94s - 202.14s]**
 through this exercise many is it? Yeah, when is it? And what are you doing?

**[202.14s - 209.54s]**
 And if you cannot think of if you don't have that in mind that's envision your

**[209.54s - 215.54s]**
 idea future 10 years from now something like that.

**[216.54s - 228.74s]**
 But as far as understand this activities in the textbook was let's envision the timeline

**[228.74s - 240.74s]**
 and like make a vivid situations. So like it started from those like those situation

**[240.74s - 247.94s]**
 about like when someone wake up in the bedroom and they will go like they will give

**[247.94s - 256.34s]**
 some vivid instructions about that's a day or yeah. I think that was kind of my intention

**[256.34s - 263.34s]**
 of having that is so that's what we will do today. So that's kind of imagery. So it's

**[263.34s - 271.74s]**
 kind of warm up warming up activity. So it's to get them think about future but it doesn't need

**[271.74s - 280.84s]**
 to be translated into a vision statement. So what I want you'll see so if you follow the book.

**[280.84s - 306.04s]**
 So there's so I asked students to people to start guide imagery and then brainstorm their dreams

**[306.04s - 319.24s]**
 according to different life stages and life span or life space. I've stages and life space and then I asked

**[319.24s - 327.64s]**
 them to write stories about their future past present future and then turn all those into a vision statement.

**[328.44s - 341.64s]**
 So having all those but asking the question about what's the essence in the stories that they have

**[341.64s - 354.84s]**
 envisioned. So through the guide imagery they will be imagining a particular time but through the dream list activity

**[355.48s - 362.28s]**
 there will be brainstorming things that there will be accomplished or conferishing in the future

**[363.08s - 370.36s]**
 considering different life roles and then that will be for the extended or expanded into life stories

**[371.08s - 381.64s]**
 of all the future and then you are turning those all those into one phrase requires them or ask

**[381.72s - 390.76s]**
 asking a question about what would be a symbolic moment or symbolic part of the story that you really

**[390.76s - 399.40s]**
 want to achieve. So that's the vision statement component. So maybe the second step of our discover

**[400.44s - 410.12s]**
 is to find what's the core aspiration points. So yeah yeah yeah yeah. So does instruction

**[410.12s - 417.96s]**
 will be could you please share what you imagine for your idea of future try to be as specific as

**[417.96s - 426.04s]**
 possible. What were you doing? How did you feel? What impact were you making? So by making those

**[427.48s - 439.40s]**
 discourses with this AI he will retrieve four at least three to five core aspirations automatically.

**[440.20s - 446.44s]**
 So those will be helpful to draft their vision. Yeah but for visual statement

**[448.92s - 458.20s]**
 ideally it would be to extract one core component in the future. So it's

**[458.28s - 459.72s]**
 um

**[462.60s - 468.52s]**
 where if that core component can encompass some other things that can be really helpful.

**[471.00s - 474.12s]**
 What the vision statement needs to be symbolic.

**[474.60s - 491.88s]**
 So the question should be whether they receive the assumption should be that they already have

**[492.60s - 500.68s]**
 developed a story about their future and you can ask them to copy and paste

**[501.16s - 513.00s]**
 most important part of their future of their story and then they can paste it and then the AI can

**[513.00s - 521.72s]**
 ask what's the essence of this story and how would you turn it into one short phrase making it

**[521.72s - 525.88s]**
 highly motivational and symbolic and things like that.

**[530.44s - 538.68s]**
 Yeah so the four steps of this AI activities will help you through those

**[539.16s - 544.52s]**
 help you through to have one compact

**[546.84s - 551.32s]**
 expression phrase. Yeah.

**[552.28s - 554.28s]**
 Yeah.

**[563.56s - 568.60s]**
 But yeah I'll try to refine it but what would be the today's activity?

**[569.80s - 576.20s]**
 Like do I do it to use this one in this class? Maybe

**[577.16s - 583.00s]**
 I think that this app is not ready to be used for today.

**[584.60s - 587.24s]**
 But I think yeah let's work on it further.

**[587.88s - 600.28s]**
 But once they have some stories and they let's say if they have the dream list and stories

**[600.92s - 613.00s]**
 from a future moment and then they can put that info onto here then AI can ask a series of questions

**[614.92s - 619.80s]**
 to identify what's the most important part in the future.

**[619.96s - 635.08s]**
 So I wanted to experiment with people here I see I'll be recording to help

**[635.08s - 636.76s]**
 our whosong to process.

**[636.76s - 638.76s]**
 Recording in progress.

**[638.76s - 645.16s]**
 So can anyone share your idea of your state?

**[645.64s - 655.96s]**
 But I think first of all it could be more clear if we can or you can give us like

**[657.64s - 660.36s]**
 specific themes.

**[660.36s - 672.60s]**
 Like is it work related or is it our like yeah laser related?

**[672.60s - 680.68s]**
 It should be I think about for this vision activity if we can make it relate to professional

**[680.68s - 683.24s]**
 self. Yeah professional self.

**[683.24s - 685.48s]**
 Yeah professional self that would be wonderful.

**[685.48s - 691.72s]**
 So otherwise people would say oh nice big house in somewhere by the lake and so on so

**[692.36s - 694.84s]**
 yeah make it professional self.

**[694.84s - 695.08s]**
 Yeah.

**[695.88s - 697.08s]**
 Yeah.

**[698.12s - 702.44s]**
 I think like many of like individuals have their own

**[703.88s - 714.84s]**
 future states and like we realized that's like girls in the class vision themselves like vividly

**[716.44s - 720.36s]**
 in their future ages with their families with her families.

**[721.24s - 727.00s]**
 If we don't really give those kind of instructions she will envision herself

**[728.04s - 729.24s]**
 with her families.

**[729.24s - 731.80s]**
 That's clear too.

**[731.80s - 744.60s]**
 So what can what they may be prone to me missing is the professional element.

**[744.68s - 756.44s]**
 So people can envision those personal or life components but that's very important from my

**[756.44s - 764.60s]**
 balance or a working perspective but the professional self should should be the anchor

**[765.88s - 770.12s]**
 in those parts and in this class.

**[771.08s - 783.56s]**
 So can you for example like to help them think on that moment to get them like some questions

**[783.56s - 787.64s]**
 like shorter questions to help them to think further?

**[790.20s - 797.08s]**
 So that that will be done today so through guide imagery there will be series of questions

**[797.08s - 803.96s]**
 narrations so it'll be a matter of doing something similar for different stages of their life.

**[805.40s - 806.60s]**
 Yeah.

**[806.60s - 810.28s]**
 Like for example I don't know if you're sitting in

**[814.52s - 819.48s]**
 it's not a meditation but when some more just accident close your eyes.

**[819.48s - 820.28s]**
 I think you're doing it.

**[820.28s - 821.72s]**
 Yeah that will do it today.

**[823.16s - 824.68s]**
 That's kind of imagery.

**[824.68s - 828.60s]**
 So let me will use the same process.

**[854.68s - 875.88s]**
 This is a long, long version just for if there's something like you would have to

**[875.88s - 881.88s]**
 do.

**[884.04s - 886.52s]**
 Yeah I need to find a shorter version.

**[886.68s - 888.52s]**
 This one is

**[897.88s - 906.44s]**
 Fatma did you follow the guided imagery when you volunteer in the DC area?

**[908.84s - 909.64s]**
 Yes.

**[909.64s - 910.44s]**
 Okay.

**[910.44s - 911.64s]**
 I did it.

**[911.64s - 912.28s]**
 Yeah.

**[912.28s - 912.44s]**
 So

**[916.52s - 920.52s]**
 yeah that was maybe a few years ago.

**[920.52s - 921.00s]**
 Yeah.

**[921.00s - 923.72s]**
 I didn't think that it would work.

**[925.08s - 928.84s]**
 Yeah so this script that I'm sharing is for

**[930.68s - 932.36s]**
 mid-life people.

**[933.40s - 937.72s]**
 So I have another version for younger ones.

**[939.80s - 944.12s]**
 So here I sit there comfortably in the answer chair.

**[944.12s - 946.60s]**
 Play sports field, flat on the floor,

**[947.64s - 950.28s]**
 technically close your eyes, breathing deeply,

**[950.92s - 953.72s]**
 excess slowly and so on.

**[953.72s - 954.04s]**
 And then

**[956.92s - 962.20s]**
 so but looking back five years wouldn't be much valuable for this group.

**[962.20s - 963.48s]**
 So we will not do this

**[964.20s - 967.32s]**
 that will ask them to see.

**[967.88s - 971.48s]**
 Even like when they are

**[973.08s - 977.72s]**
 choosing their majors so maybe five years before now,

**[978.44s - 985.16s]**
 and how they like how is their thinking when they want to choose their major?

**[985.16s - 993.88s]**
 How what's helping to choose for example this university and this major and if they will

**[993.88s - 995.40s]**
 continue on this major?

**[996.36s - 998.60s]**
 What is their like thoughts?

**[1001.48s - 1006.76s]**
 Yeah I need to think about that some students

**[1008.84s - 1012.52s]**
 don't have their major at the moment.

**[1014.44s - 1020.36s]**
 So yeah it's a bit complicated so but for

**[1021.00s - 1022.60s]**
 or choose the university.

**[1022.60s - 1025.24s]**
 Why they choose this university?

**[1025.24s - 1027.48s]**
 For example what is their aim?

**[1028.92s - 1030.12s]**
 What they want to be?

**[1031.72s - 1033.00s]**
 Yeah that would be good.

**[1033.00s - 1035.40s]**
 Yeah yeah having that component would be good.

**[1036.04s - 1039.00s]**
 So we can modify some of these to

**[1041.24s - 1042.44s]**
 yeah the college students.

**[1043.48s - 1044.20s]**
 So here

**[1044.92s - 1053.32s]**
 the script that I created for the midlife people was to envision a day five years from now.

**[1054.36s - 1058.12s]**
 But in my previous script it was open to them.

**[1058.76s - 1062.52s]**
 So it's up to them to decide whether it's five years or ten years.

**[1063.80s - 1064.04s]**
 And so.

**[1064.04s - 1068.36s]**
 You have like the student who are the parent here.

**[1070.20s - 1070.76s]**
 Yeah.

**[1070.76s - 1072.68s]**
 So what do I think?

**[1072.68s - 1080.12s]**
 I think when they start thinking to apply to the high school for the university and

**[1080.12s - 1084.52s]**
 they think they've been to university parks specifically.

**[1085.96s - 1088.44s]**
 What were they thinking about?

**[1091.48s - 1097.88s]**
 Yeah in many cases some students don't have much clue

**[1098.52s - 1101.32s]**
 regarding what they want to do in the future.

**[1104.04s - 1107.08s]**
 They have many of the students have vague ideas.

**[1109.64s - 1112.36s]**
 But very few have concrete ideas.

**[1114.04s - 1117.48s]**
 Anyway that's what I can experience in.

**[1120.92s - 1121.48s]**
 Are we?

**[1121.48s - 1122.04s]**
 Yeah good.

**[1122.60s - 1126.92s]**
 Are we going to use all of these instructions in our

**[1127.88s - 1129.48s]**
 activity like all class?

**[1132.12s - 1134.68s]**
 No this is for midlife people.

**[1134.68s - 1136.68s]**
 I have another proficient that can be

**[1137.32s - 1139.32s]**
 college students for the shortened one.

**[1139.96s - 1142.44s]**
 Yeah even though like my point was

**[1143.32s - 1147.48s]**
 we may spend a lot of times if we go through all of the questions here.

**[1149.00s - 1153.16s]**
 So like especially when we're doing like AI app.

**[1153.16s - 1154.52s]**
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

**[1154.68s - 1157.32s]**
 I can't do it through this one.

**[1157.32s - 1157.48s]**
 Yeah.

**[1158.52s - 1165.88s]**
 We can ask them to write down the essence of what they envisioned or what they wrote

**[1166.52s - 1167.72s]**
 and their future stories.

**[1170.68s - 1177.80s]**
 But I think applying those like one of those each questions in the AI app might be helpful.

**[1177.80s - 1182.44s]**
 Like we can use one of the questions in financial

**[1182.44s - 1186.28s]**
 style stability is one of one of one of one of questions in the proposed and many.

**[1188.68s - 1189.00s]**
 Yeah.

**[1191.96s - 1193.80s]**
 To make a like visibility.

**[1193.80s - 1194.92s]**
 Yeah for the

**[1196.68s - 1200.76s]**
 vision statement version to have a very short phrase.

**[1201.64s - 1203.88s]**
 I wouldn't put in

**[1205.48s - 1209.56s]**
 because that in that mission I have vision statement.

**[1210.20s - 1212.92s]**
 Different life rules cannot be considered

**[1213.64s - 1219.80s]**
 because we are asking them about the professional self as for the

**[1222.04s - 1230.12s]**
 vision statement and so it would be just them on be like oh I'll be a nice

**[1230.12s - 1235.96s]**
 nice grandfather or generous grandfather or I will be a millionaire or billionaire.

**[1236.60s - 1237.48s]**
 So that would be two.

**[1239.48s - 1241.96s]**
 It's about certain dimension only.

**[1243.48s - 1245.48s]**
 I'm thinking about using AI.

**[1246.52s - 1254.20s]**
 I don't know there is a tool when you like have a picture of your face and see yourself when you are young

**[1255.00s - 1259.64s]**
 and when you are growing until you become like elderly.

**[1260.60s - 1270.36s]**
 So to give them this like 10 years how they were and how they are currently and after 10

**[1270.36s - 1274.12s]**
 years how they look like. So think about them self.

**[1274.84s - 1279.08s]**
 How if this is a person that you are there.

**[1279.80s - 1288.52s]**
 How you think yourself will be working in or doing at that time until you get older.

**[1289.88s - 1291.40s]**
 By the way, there.

**[1298.84s - 1300.60s]**
 Do you have to know the app?

**[1301.24s - 1304.60s]**
 I know in snapshot there is a filter.

**[1305.40s - 1305.80s]**
 Okay.

**[1307.40s - 1310.04s]**
 But there is I think

**[1311.00s - 1314.36s]**
 should you be able to do that if you get them the picture.

**[1315.08s - 1315.56s]**
 Maybe.

**[1315.56s - 1322.68s]**
 Your picture and ask yeah and then they put their image and each 10 years.

**[1323.80s - 1324.12s]**
 Yeah.

**[1324.12s - 1325.64s]**
 How they are looking look like.

**[1330.04s - 1337.72s]**
 Considering like the vision statement is about to the professional career

**[1338.36s - 1340.36s]**
 like from the experience.

**[1340.36s - 1344.04s]**
 You can be a master career or anything.

**[1344.04s - 1347.48s]**
 Because any work related activities will be career.

**[1349.48s - 1351.00s]**
 Or business.

**[1351.00s - 1351.96s]**
 Yeah.

**[1351.96s - 1356.76s]**
 Creating something, having a business or taking a certain role.

**[1362.60s - 1362.92s]**
 Yeah.

**[1363.72s - 1371.08s]**
 So I'm not sure this activity will be helpful to

**[1372.68s - 1377.96s]**
 retrieve some career related core aspirations term.

**[1380.44s - 1389.40s]**
 What about those like past future of past current and the future stories

**[1390.20s - 1395.32s]**
 to retrieve the core aspirations in their career.

**[1396.36s - 1396.68s]**
 Yeah.

**[1396.68s - 1401.32s]**
 So we can ask them to copy and paste their future stories.

**[1402.44s - 1406.68s]**
 So they will have written past current and future stories.

**[1407.48s - 1410.20s]**
 Because vision is about the future.

**[1410.20s - 1414.04s]**
 We just need only need the future story for the AI.

**[1414.84s - 1418.44s]**
 So we can ask them to copy and paste the future stories.

**[1419.24s - 1421.88s]**
 And then AI can ask some questions.

**[1422.44s - 1427.64s]**
 And also double check whether there is sufficient information about their professional self.

**[1429.16s - 1429.40s]**
 Yeah.

**[1431.00s - 1433.88s]**
 That's yeah that's what I thought.

**[1433.88s - 1442.44s]**
 But if we can like connect those past and current with the future.

**[1443.00s - 1450.92s]**
 So AI can help connecting those components with the future statement which is our

**[1451.64s - 1454.68s]**
 our direction, our objective.

**[1455.32s - 1459.08s]**
 The connecting anchor is the mission statement.

**[1463.96s - 1467.96s]**
 And the professional self needs to be linked to the mission statement.

**[1468.68s - 1470.20s]**
 And in many cases,

**[1475.64s - 1480.36s]**
 the self is connected throughout their lives.

**[1483.96s - 1489.24s]**
 It can be like the past cannot.

**[1490.04s - 1495.24s]**
 Although if you don't do anything, the past can be a good prediction for your future.

**[1495.24s - 1501.80s]**
 But in this class, the belief is that you can create your own desired future.

**[1504.28s - 1512.44s]**
 So I have this course help students to crystallize who they are based on their past stories,

**[1512.44s - 1513.72s]**
 life themes and so on.

**[1513.72s - 1520.12s]**
 So life themes will stay through the future as well.

**[1520.12s - 1523.32s]**
 So that maybe that's why you are saying the past will be connected.

**[1523.40s - 1525.96s]**
 But that's connected through like themes.

**[1525.96s - 1533.08s]**
 So if we can ask them to put in their life themes, their mission statement,

**[1533.72s - 1537.56s]**
 that can be a good guide for the future.

**[1540.04s - 1547.96s]**
 But somehow because I want them to intentionally create their idea of future,

**[1547.96s - 1559.64s]**
 I don't want to interfere the future component by providing the stories of the past.

**[1566.76s - 1575.16s]**
 But I just wanted to make a clear structure of their division statements module.

**[1578.76s - 1583.00s]**
 I'm going to revise the structures after having this question here.

**[1586.60s - 1590.76s]**
 Yeah, but I just wanted to like apply some of the components here.

**[1590.76s - 1593.24s]**
 Is that some of the structures in this textbook or

**[1594.68s - 1599.08s]**
 any already existing structures here?

**[1600.28s - 1601.00s]**
 The canvas.

**[1601.00s - 1604.44s]**
 As I mentioned, life themes and life values.

**[1604.44s - 1606.84s]**
 Also values are likely to stay.

**[1607.40s - 1611.16s]**
 They are important values and mission statement.

**[1611.16s - 1616.68s]**
 And those can be one of the inputs and life stories, their future stories.

**[1617.32s - 1620.52s]**
 So those will be input and we can go from there.

**[1621.32s - 1630.92s]**
 So do you want me make users cannot proceed without having those results?

**[1631.88s - 1640.92s]**
 So we already have the right values and the mission statement in our website.

**[1640.92s - 1643.64s]**
 So do you want me to do it?

**[1649.16s - 1652.04s]**
 So you can ask them to supply those.

**[1652.28s - 1664.20s]**
 And if they already have written the life stories, including the future part,

**[1664.20s - 1667.40s]**
 it can be life stories and dreams and so on.

**[1669.08s - 1671.56s]**
 They can paste all those.

**[1674.44s - 1676.28s]**
 Then AI can summarize those.

**[1676.36s - 1683.16s]**
 But what AI should ask is, if you were to choose only one of these, only one,

**[1684.68s - 1686.20s]**
 what would that be?

**[1686.68s - 1687.56s]**
 And when is it?

**[1688.28s - 1691.08s]**
 And then there will be the timeframe for the vision.

**[1691.72s - 1699.08s]**
 And the AI should help the students to develop highly,

**[1699.08s - 1705.32s]**
 I can say, attractive vision statement.

**[1706.52s - 1711.64s]**
 So supplying mission, the stories and various life themes and so on

**[1712.68s - 1718.84s]**
 would be the starting point to, and also the list of dreams.

**[1721.08s - 1724.68s]**
 And it can be also the results of their guided imagery.

**[1724.76s - 1729.56s]**
 So after the guided imagery, what I asked them to write down is,

**[1730.84s - 1739.40s]**
 any of the scenes that they have envisioned, if they want to remember

**[1742.04s - 1746.76s]**
 it for future career, I asked them to write it down.

**[1747.64s - 1757.48s]**
 And if they can supply that in the app as well, that would also be a very helpful.

**[1761.96s - 1768.28s]**
 And some of the questions I ask is the magnitude of impact

**[1769.24s - 1772.12s]**
 or which of their influence.

**[1773.16s - 1780.04s]**
 So whether they want to reach people in their country, or in their community,

**[1780.04s - 1784.44s]**
 or it would be internationally, or how many and so on.

**[1784.44s - 1791.64s]**
 So I asked them those questions when they come up with a vision statement.

**[1791.64s - 1794.52s]**
 So those are some of the questions that they can ask.

**[1794.52s - 1795.64s]**
 The AI can ask.

**[1796.12s - 1801.56s]**
 I found this, but I don't know the talk.

**[1801.56s - 1806.84s]**
 So they can put their picture and see in different ages how they would be.

**[1806.84s - 1812.04s]**
 So that might be what happened to Imagine herself.

**[1812.04s - 1814.44s]**
 So just one sec.

**[1814.44s - 1820.04s]**
 So I need to think about how you would be able to use the image.

**[1820.76s - 1825.64s]**
 And so I need to think about how you would be able to use this

**[1826.92s - 1835.56s]**
 in class, if this is in class activity, but the song that gives to you.

**[1850.76s - 1855.00s]**
 So I'm going to put it in the cup.

**[1862.68s - 1866.92s]**
 I think it's like, maybe i typed the про,

**[1868.52s - 1869.64s]**
 Uh, Charlotte?

**[1869.64s - 1880.96s]**
 I just want to give it the same.

**[1880.96s - 1886.00s]**
 I typed it the same but it doesn't come up.

**[1886.00s - 1888.00s]**
 But it looks the same.

**[1888.00s - 1890.00s]**
 So which one is the same?

**[1890.00s - 1895.00s]**
 The one that I give to.

**[1895.00s - 1899.00s]**
 This is one of them.

**[1899.00s - 1905.00s]**
 Yeah, it doesn't come up that way.

**[1905.00s - 1911.00s]**
 So I mean it test how it works if we want to use it.

**[1911.00s - 1915.00s]**
 This is a bit...

**[1915.00s - 1918.00s]**
 It looks like a bit of a...

**[1918.00s - 1921.00s]**
 ...mocking thing.

**[1921.00s - 1925.00s]**
 Why do you like it?

**[1925.00s - 1928.00s]**
 It's so...

**[1941.00s - 1951.00s]**
 Yeah, another thing to consider is the privacy.

**[1951.00s - 1958.00s]**
 So some stills may feel uncomfortable putting that photo in.

**[1958.00s - 1961.00s]**
 So look at you and the photo.

**[1961.00s - 1968.00s]**
 You have to like, for example, the difference between the mission and vision.

**[1968.00s - 1971.00s]**
 This is my big mistake for some.

**[1971.00s - 1974.00s]**
 Yeah, I can explain.

**[1974.00s - 1981.00s]**
 Yeah.

**[2004.00s - 2011.00s]**
 Today we are able to guide the imagery and then trim this activity.

**[2011.00s - 2015.00s]**
 Let's see.

**[2015.00s - 2024.00s]**
 I will share my screen.

**[2024.00s - 2038.00s]**
 So Dr. Yann, I will share the revised structure by following your current feedback with you.

**[2038.00s - 2048.00s]**
 Let's start revising the structure after reviewing the documentation.
