[8.37s - 11.54s] in progress.
[43.23s - 51.31s] 20.
[51.33s - 54.88s] 20 years from now, 20.
[55.08s - 58.41s] To me, it's the basic steam.
[135.47s - 137.18s] you
[202.97s - 221.05s] For example, when you are working
[234.22s - 236.34s] Okay, you think so?
[272.76s - 274.57s] Hmm.
[337.73s - 339.42s] If you have a lot of questions, let's see.
[341.30s - 342.58s] Thank you for clarifying.
[342.60s - 346.37s] It's inside how your vision is created at multiple levels from individuals.
[346.39s - 347.69s] It's all going to change.
[347.88s - 349.30s] It's a way up to the level.
[349.32s - 352.62s] I want to share this with you.
[352.64s - 355.23s] Let's focus on it as well as focus on this vision.
[355.25s - 357.94s] Let's see your reading is multifested.
[373.07s - 373.97s] It's okay.
[373.99s - 374.34s] It's okay.
[407.83s - 432.83s] I get into very details as well.
[483.53s - 508.17s] How do you divide your time to turn out?
[508.19s - 509.05s] When will this end?
[510.13s - 511.74s] So let's see.
[532.45s - 534.29s] in a picture of one of those moments.
[534.31s - 536.42s] Okay, fear you are pushing
[662.49s - 689.78s] So I already have my pigeons, so that's why I'm just amazing.
[689.98s - 712.19s] Yeah, I just found there's an explicit end point of the conversation, but all you need to do in this process is to write the free writing area.
[730.65s - 733.07s] It's been conversation.
[733.09s - 734.48s] Here's a threat for the region.
[734.84s - 742.56s] Oh, because my fear is that if we do pre-writing, people would may have hard time.
[743.96s - 744.85s] Yeah, we'll see.
[744.92s - 747.61s] But I think these questions will help her.
[748.45s - 749.15s] Let's see.
[752.63s - 757.64s] Transform 10 million dreams into reality through innovative solutions that are critical.
[781.51s - 794.79s] My criteria for pigeon statement is pigeon statement.
[799.08s - 804.97s] So here it will be like 10 million dreams come true or 10 million dreams.
[854.29s - 858.36s] So I can give examples.
[858.70s - 859.18s] Let's see.
[874.34s - 875.58s] So yeah, I can
[883.10s - 890.59s] And so I think it's important.
[896.00s - 898.77s] I need to share this with students today as well.
[900.15s - 902.71s] So here are some between students.
[920.82s - 950.42s] But in my understanding and what textbook guided was
[950.57s - 962.73s] to shorten or to shorten or lessen the big chunk of ideas into smaller ones.
[963.15s - 967.29s] So I think this is just one step, first step of the process.
[967.43s - 970.88s] Can you go?
[970.90s - 975.97s] I mean, there's a four steps of a whole year.
[976.42s - 978.26s] Yeah, just a step one.
[978.70s - 983.83s] So it's kind of like it's kind of giving like imaginary situations.
[985.35s - 992.11s] So you need to write down the favorite area.
[992.17s - 997.34s] So this is step one.
[997.54s - 999.64s] Yeah.
[999.70s - 1000.34s] Yeah.
[1000.36s - 1003.84s] Can you just copy like the
[1005.60s - 1010.52s] the what AI gave as a whole paragraph?
[1010.54s - 1011.78s] Can I just copy this one?
[1012.04s - 1012.24s] Yeah.
[1016.17s - 1018.67s] Let's see, prove this.
[1018.69s - 1020.37s] Successfully next step, okay.
[1022.21s - 1026.46s] And then core aspirations, chat with AI.
[1030.48s - 1032.36s] Let me find core aspirations.
[1034.64s - 1035.50s] That's right.
[1035.52s - 1038.12s] Do you realize your future teponix or core teams?
[1039.34s - 1062.94s] Let me go ahead.
[1062.96s - 1064.44s] I already mentioned that.
[1074.21s - 1078.45s] We wanted to stay within a professional setting.
[1079.63s - 1083.28s] So I'll try.
[1083.30s - 1090.98s] Is this part necessary?
[1092.35s - 1099.67s] Because even if you have a list of core aspirations, it will come down to one aspect.
[1099.99s - 1103.25s] Or you can be integrating to one, but
[1103.94s - 1110.99s] This process might interfere creating one phrase or one sentence.
[1111.57s - 1113.28s] Yeah.
[1116.72s - 1122.39s] In this process, we will set up three or five core aspirations.
[1122.53s - 1132.46s] And then after all, just one last core aspiration will last remains.
[1132.82s - 1136.85s] This is too complicated for our students.
[1141.50s - 1144.01s] Can we just test one to three or so?
[1185.40s - 1205.47s] I think we can go next step.
[1274.48s - 1281.90s] I think there are some errors into the summary of the impact vision.
[1293.06s - 1295.33s] This is not a summary.
[1305.09s - 1306.63s] Yeah, so it needs to be guided.
[1306.89s - 1331.76s] Let's say let's get hard number.
[1335.65s - 1341.00s] And you should copy one of these sentences.
[1342.34s - 1342.82s] Are here?
[1342.84s - 1343.08s] Yeah.
[1360.34s - 1360.84s] No, no, no.
[1361.46s - 1361.98s] I'm there.
[1364.07s - 1366.17s] Another layout.
[1367.30s - 1368.04s] No, no, no.
[1368.56s - 1374.46s] Generates vision statements under this box under the box.
[1374.48s - 1375.81s] Here.
[1379.91s - 1380.13s] Yeah.
[1387.12s - 1388.86s] I think we can go next.
[1393.64s - 1403.35s] Okay, so this is this carpet.
[1403.37s - 1404.43s] Okay, okay, okay.
[1409.22s - 1410.38s] So who's on?
[1412.39s - 1419.04s] If you can make it far simpler than this one, that will be open.
[1419.39s - 1427.82s] So I was thinking removing the core aspiration can be more concise.
[1428.20s - 1442.43s] But I think we can remain choosing three, like one aspirations from the image and feature.
[1442.59s - 1447.02s] And then also you can ask students to tweak it.
[1447.57s - 1477.20s] modify it and then give but I think the criteria for visions they must be six words or less what I would do and then there should be a direction here so this is you can say here step one to check with AI coach to step two take important content
[1478.23s - 1486.66s] Or can you just delete this part?
[1486.68s - 1487.72s] Yeah, you can delete it.
[1488.02s - 1503.64s] And once you can say the goal of this one should be to come up with these descriptions.
[1504.03s - 1506.23s] Yeah.
[1506.46s - 1511.27s] If AIQ is that there is enough content describing the future.
[1514.09s - 1522.43s] So you can, the AI should keep providing summaries and also ask questions until there's some substantive information.
[1522.61s - 1528.66s] So AIQ can ask, oh, it seems that this is what you want to, you are envisioning.
[1529.14s - 1534.01s] Does it capture your desired future accurately in the story format?
[1534.31s - 1563.18s] if it yes surely move on to the next step yes then yeah please click on next step something like that that way you can eliminate this part and then yeah that data will be saved in the next step and check we so yeah it will be eliminated and direct vision will be based on that story so you can here I can brainstorm
[1563.40s - 1571.75s] a potential vision statement in six or as or less, then S4 revision.
[1572.69s - 1576.81s] And so, and ask the challenging questions, like magnitude of impact.
[1577.77s - 1591.24s] I think the second step is not core aspirations, but to clarify regarding with the which magnitude impact and so on to the part that you asked in step three.
[1592.61s - 1599.24s] And step three will give ideas that could be used as a vision statement.
[1599.32s - 1601.72s] So this is kind of selection part.
[1601.74s - 1618.76s] And then, yeah, I think step four and three and four can be one step because I couldn't see much added value of having, yeah, this is just to make a decision.
[1619.74s - 1620.19s] Maybe
[1620.52s - 1621.62s] track vision.
[1621.64s - 1622.26s] It's okay.
[1622.46s - 1622.88s] Okay.
[1622.96s - 1624.38s] So here.
[1624.42s - 1624.95s] Okay.
[1629.23s - 1632.80s] Next step.
[1632.82s - 1633.28s] Oh, okay.
[1633.30s - 1636.60s] Next step is first section.
[1638.44s - 1638.89s] Okay.
[1639.33s - 1640.59s] What if I don't validate?
[1644.77s - 1646.53s] Yeah, it should be.
[1646.59s - 1650.34s] Yeah, we need to give them an option to modify.
[1651.30s - 1657.23s] But do you want me to, like, still use the validation criteria?
[1657.27s - 1659.85s] Like, do you want to create some...
[1659.87s - 1671.49s] It's not to validate, it's to ask them to envision their future more vividly, including the impact numbers if they can stay.
[1671.90s - 1675.17s] or the witch, whether it's globally and so on.
[1675.31s - 1680.70s] So you listed those up, I think.
[1680.72s - 1690.47s] But you mentioned just one, like, validation sentence, like, which should contain just, like, less than six words?
[1691.25s - 1693.49s] Six or less, let's do this six or less.
[1694.27s - 1701.84s] So it's not something that the human click, it's, so you need to give them, give the AI,
[1702.41s - 1708.64s] the criteria, so that when AI suggests it will be the vision statement to be six words or less.
[1715.25s - 1720.42s] So it's not to validate it to, maybe the final version is to compome.
[1720.58s - 1730.43s] If you say, but if they don't click on compome, then that means that
[1731.00s - 1732.88s] There needs to be room for change.
[1735.43s - 1738.65s] Yes, think about how you will make it finalized.
[1739.57s - 1739.83s] OK.
[1742.56s - 1746.88s] But can that be done in the next two hours?
[1748.06s - 1749.84s] Because we need to share it with students.
[1751.99s - 1756.43s] Yeah, I'll share it in one hour.
[1757.07s - 1759.64s] OK. And you can test it.
[1760.36s - 1760.42s] OK.
[1761.07s - 1762.90s] Okay, sounds good.
[1763.88s - 1769.23s] So yeah, let's check.
