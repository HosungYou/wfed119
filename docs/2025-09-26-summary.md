# 2025-09-26 Engineering Summary

## Context
- Investigated repeated save failures in the Values and Strengths discovery modules on the Render deployment.
- Identified Prisma schema drift between the repository and production database (missing insights columns/tables) as the primary root cause.
- Coordinated schema updates, API refinements, and UX adjustments to ensure module outputs persist with enriched insights.

## Key Changes
1. **Prisma Schema Alignment**
   - Added user linkage fields to `Session`/`Strength`.
   - Introduced `ValueResult.insights` & `moduleVersion`, plus the new `StrengthProfile` table for summarised strength outputs.
   - Documented schema interactions in `docs/module-data-architecture.md` for future modules.
2. **API Enhancements**
   - Strengths: `/api/session/save` now upserts `StrengthProfile`, enriches `Strength` rows, and keeps `UserSession` metadata in sync.
   - Values: `/api/discover/values/results` persists bucket stats, pattern summaries, and generated insights alongside the raw layout.
3. **UX Improvements**
   - Added Google sign-in/out control on the landing page header to streamline authentication before saving.
4. **Deployment Guidance**
   - Captured the manual Prisma commands needed on Render (`db push --accept-data-loss`, `prisma generate`) to resynchronise the remote schema when running through the Accelerate proxy.

## Follow-up
- Monitor Render logs after deployment to confirm saves return 200 responses for both modules.
- Consider automating non-destructive migrations to avoid manual intervention for future schema changes.
- Extend the documentation pattern to upcoming modules so each exposes raw artefacts + structured insights.
