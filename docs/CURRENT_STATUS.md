# Vision Statement Module - Current Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09 17:30 EST
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Ready for Testing

---

## 📊 Current Architecture (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Imagine Future** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `/src/app/discover/vision/step1/`

**User Flow**:
1. User chats with AI about their future vision (10 years ahead)
2. AI asks challenging questions:
   - "How many people will your work impact?"
   - "Is this impact global, national, or local?"
   - "What makes this meaningful beyond yourself?"
3. After 5-7 exchanges, AI generates cohesive paragraph
4. AI presents paragraph with markers: `📝 DRAFT_START` ... `DRAFT_END`
5. AI asks: **"Does this accurately capture your desired future in story format?"**
6. User reviews paragraph in read-only display box
7. If YES → AI says: **"Great! Please click 'Next Step' to create your vision statement."**
8. User clicks "Next Step" → Go to Step 3 (Step 2 not yet implemented)

**UI Components**:
- ✅ AI Chat Box (with challenging questions)
- ✅ AI-Generated Paragraph Display (read-only, auto-filled from draft)
- ✅ "Clear & Restart" button (if user wants to redo)
- ✅ "Save Progress" button
- ✅ "Next Step" button (active when paragraph exists)

**What Changed from Original**:
- ❌ REMOVED: Free Writing Area (user manual typing)
- ✅ ADDED: AI-generated paragraph with confirmation flow
- ✅ ADDED: Impact magnitude and scope questions

---

### **Step 2: Brainstorm Vision** 🚧 NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `/src/app/discover/vision/step2/` - **DOES NOT EXIST**

**Status**:
- ✅ AI Prompt ready (in `/api/discover/vision/ai-chat/route.ts`)
- ❌ UI not created
- ❌ Folder removed (old Core Aspirations backed up to `step2-old-core-aspirations/`)

**Planned Flow** (when implemented):
1. AI reviews Step 1 paragraph
2. AI generates 3-5 six-word vision options
3. User selects one OR creates custom
4. Word counter validates 6-word limit
5. Save to database (`brainstormed_options`, `selected_option_index`)
6. Next Step → Go to Step 3

**Current Workaround**:
- Step 1 → **Directly to Step 3** (skipping Step 2)
- User manually types vision in Step 3

---

### **Step 3: Compose & Visualize** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `/src/app/discover/vision/step3/` (formerly step4/)

**User Flow**:
1. User enters/edits vision statement
2. **Real-time word counter** shows "X / 6 words"
3. Visual feedback:
   - ≤6 words: Green checkmark ✓
   - >6 words: Red warning ⚠
4. Click "AI Review" button
5. AI validates:
   - Word count (STRICT: 6 or less)
   - Clarity
   - Impact magnitude
   - Inspiring quality
6. AI provides feedback + suggestions
7. If passed: "Confirm & Accept" button appears
8. User confirms → Validation complete
9. Select vision card template
10. Download vision card as PNG
11. "Complete Vision Statement" → Module done

**UI Components**:
- ✅ Textarea with real-time word counter
- ✅ Visual feedback (red/green)
- ✅ AI Review button (formerly "Validate")
- ✅ Confirm & Accept flow
- ✅ Vision Card templates
- ✅ Download PNG functionality

## 🎯 What Actually Works Right Now

### ✅ Fully Functional:
1. **3-Step Navigation** (StepProgress component)
2. **Step 1**:
   - AI conversation with impact/scope questions
   - AI generates paragraph with draft markers
   - Auto-fills to display box
   - Confirmation flow ("Does this capture...")
3. **Step 3**:
   - Real-time word counter (X / 6 words)
   - Visual feedback (red/green)
   - AI validation endpoint (6-word check)
   - Confirm & Accept flow
   - Vision card generation

### 🚧 Partially Complete:
1. **Step 2**:
   - AI prompt ready ✅
   - No UI yet ❌
   - Database migration file created ✅
   - Migration not run yet ❌

### ⚠️ Known Issues:
1. **Navigation Gap**: Step 1 → Step 3 directly (Step 2 skipped)
2. **Step 2 Missing**: Old "Core Aspirations" removed, new "Brainstorm" not built
3. **Database**: Migration SQL created but not executed on production

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: Step 1 Flow
```
1. Go to /discover/vision
2. Click "Start Vision Statement"
3. Chat with AI (5-7 messages)
4. AI generates paragraph in markers
5. Paragraph auto-fills display box
6. AI asks: "Does this capture your vision?"
7. Respond "Yes" in chat
8. AI says: "Click Next Step!"
9. Click "Next Step" button
10. ✅ Should go to Step 3 (skipping Step 2)
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Paragraph appears in read-only box
- ✅ "Clear & Restart" button available
- ✅ "Save Progress" button works
- ✅ "Next Step" redirects to `/discover/vision/step3`

### Test Scenario 2: Step 3 Word Counter
```
1. Enter vision: "Transform 10 million dreams into reality"
2. Check word counter
3. Try longer: "Transform 10 million dreams into beautiful reality now"
4. Check word counter
```

**Expected**:
- Input 1: "6 / 6 words" + Green ✓
- Input 2: "8 / 6 words" + Red ⚠ "Please reduce to 6 or less"

### Test Scenario 3: AI Validation
```
1. Enter 6-word vision
2. Click "AI Review"
3. Wait for AI response
4. If passed: Click "Confirm & Accept"
5. Select vision card template
6. Download PNG
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ AI checks word count first
- ✅ Feedback appears in colored box (green/yellow)
- ✅ Suggestions if >6 words
- ✅ "Confirm & Accept" only if passed
- ✅ Vision card displays 6-word statement

## 📝 What's Different from Documentation

### Documentation Said:
- **4 steps** → Step 1, 2, 3, 4

### Reality Is:
- **Currently 2.5 steps** → Step 1 ✅, Step 2 ❌ (skipped), Step 3 ✅

### Documentation Said (Step 1):
- Free Writing Area (user types)

### Reality Is (Step 1):
- AI-generated paragraph (read-only display)
- User confirms, not edits

### Documentation Said (Step 2):
- "Brainstorm 6-word visions"
- AI suggests 3-5 options
- User selects

### Reality Is (Step 2):
- **Does not exist yet**
- Folder removed
- AI prompt ready but no UI

## 📌 Important Notes

### For Testing:
1. **Step 2 is missing** - navigation jumps from Step 1 to Step 3
2. This is intentional for now - Step 2 UI not yet built
3. Users can still create vision statements in Step 3 manually

### For Development:
1. **Database migration not run** - `brainstormed_options` columns don't exist yet
2. Run migration before implementing Step 2 UI
3. Old Step 2 data preserved in `step2-old-core-aspirations/`

### For Deployment:
1. **Git push completed** ✅
2. Changes live on main branch
3. Production should redeploy automatically (Render)
4. Test on: `wfed119-1.onrender.com` (or configured domain)

**Status**: Ready for testing Step 1 → Step 3 flow
**Last Commit**: `cceff2a - fix: Merge conflicts - keep redesign changes`
**Next Review**: After testing feedback
