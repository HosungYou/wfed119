# Step 1 AI Prompt Strategy Review & Optimization

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Purpose**: Review and optimize the Step 1 prompt engineering strategy to reduce unnecessary questions and improve user experience.

---

## Current Problems

### 1. Too Many Questions ‚ùå
The current prompt instructs AI to ask 4 categories of questions:
- Visual Details
- Emotional Exploration
- Activity Specification
- Relationship Questions

**Problem**: This creates a long, exhausting conversation (5-7 exchanges minimum).

### 2. Redundant Information Gathering ‚ùå
AI asks for information already available in context:
- Values are already known
- Strengths are already known
- User profile is available

**Problem**: Wastes user time re-answering what system already knows.

### 3. Unclear Draft Trigger ‚ùå
Current trigger: "After 5-7 exchanges, assess if conversation has matured"

**Problem**: Too vague, AI might wait too long or generate draft too early.

---

## Optimized Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **"Ask ONLY what we don't already know"**
2. **"Quality over speed - ALL requirements must be met"**
3. **"2-3 exchanges maximum, but NEVER compromise on requirements"**

### New Approach: 2-3 Exchange Flow with Strict Requirements

#### Required Information Checklist

**Draft is ONLY generated when ALL 4 requirements are met:**

1. ‚úÖ **Professional Role/Work Type**
   - Example: "Non-profit leader", "Tech entrepreneur", "Product designer"
   - If missing: "What would your primary professional role be?"

2. ‚úÖ **Impact Magnitude with Numbers** (MUST include specific numbers)
   - Example: "50,000 students", "100 communities", "1 million users"
   - If missing: "How many people or communities would your work impact? Be specific with numbers."

3. ‚úÖ **Scope** (MUST be explicit)
   - Example: "national", "global", "local community", "organizational"
   - If missing: "Is this impact local, national, or global?"

4. ‚úÖ **Target Beneficiaries** (MUST be specific)
   - Example: "underserved high school students", "small business owners", "rural communities"
   - If missing: "Who specifically benefits from this work?"

**If ANY requirement is missing ‚Üí AI asks targeted clarification questions before generating draft.**

---

#### Exchange 1: AI Opens with Context-Rich Question
AI asks ONE targeted question that incorporates user's values/strengths AND requests all 4 requirements:

**Example**:
```
Looking at your core values (Innovation, Impact, Collaboration) and your
top strength (Strategic Thinking), imagine yourself 10 years from now:

What's the ONE professional achievement or impact that would make you feel
most fulfilled? Be as specific as possible about the scale and scope.

(For example: "Empowering 100,000 underserved students through AI education"
or "Building a sustainable tech company that employs 500+ people")
```

**Why this works**:
- ‚úÖ Single question (not overwhelming)
- ‚úÖ Incorporates known context (values/strengths)
- ‚úÖ Asks for CONCRETE details (scale, scope, impact)
- ‚úÖ Provides examples to guide response quality

---

#### Exchange 2: Requirements Check + Clarification
AI checks user's response against the 4 requirements. Two possible paths:

**Path A: All requirements met ‚Üí Generate draft immediately**

**Path B: Missing requirements ‚Üí Show checklist + ask for missing info**

**Example (Path B - Missing Requirements)**:
```
Great start! To create your vision story, I need a bit more specificity:

‚úÖ Role: Non-profit leader (clear!)
‚ùå Numbers: You mentioned "many students" - can you estimate? (e.g., 5,000? 50,000?)
‚úÖ Scope: National (clear!)
‚ùå Beneficiaries: Who specifically? (e.g., "underserved high school students"?)

These details will make your vision much more powerful!
```

**Why this works**:
- ‚úÖ Visual checklist shows progress
- ‚úÖ Only asks for missing items (not redundant)
- ‚úÖ Provides examples to guide quality
- ‚úÖ Explains WHY details matter

---

#### Exchange 3: Draft Generation (Only When Complete)
After receiving missing details, AI generates draft ONLY if all 4 requirements are now met.

**Example**:
```
Perfect! I now have everything needed to create your vision story.

Summary of your vision:
- **Role**: Non-profit leader
- **Impact**: 50,000 underserved students nationally
- **Beneficiaries**: High school students in low-income communities
- **Values Alignment**: Innovation in Education driving systemic change

üìù DRAFT_START
Ten years from now, I lead a thriving non-profit organization that has
transformed tech education access for over 50,000 underserved high school
students across the United States. Through innovative AI and coding curriculum,
strategic partnerships with leading tech companies, and hands-on mentorship,
I empower communities that have been historically excluded from the tech industry.

## Revised Prompt Structure

### System Prompt Changes

**BEFORE** (Current):
```
Guide:
1. Visual Details: "Where do you wake up?", "What do you see around you?"
2. Emotional Exploration: "How do you feel in that moment?"
3. Activity Specification: "What is the most meaningful moment of your day?"
4. Relationship Questions: "Who do you spend time with?"

After 5-7 exchanges, assess if the conversation has matured...
```

**AFTER** (Optimized):
```
Conversation Strategy:
1. **Opening Question** (Exchange 1): Ask ONE context-rich question incorporating
   user's top value and strength. Request specific scale/scope/impact details.

   Template: "Looking at your core value of [VALUE] and strength in [STRENGTH],
   imagine 10 years from now: What's the ONE professional achievement that would
   make you most fulfilled? Include specific scale and scope."

2. **Clarification + Draft** (Exchange 2): If user provides sufficient detail
   (magnitude, scope, role), immediately generate draft. If details are vague,
   ask 1-2 targeted follow-ups, then generate draft.

3. **Draft Generation Trigger**: Generate draft when you have:
   - ‚úÖ Professional role/work type
   - ‚úÖ Impact magnitude (e.g., "100,000 students", "global communities")
   - ‚úÖ Scope (global/national/local/organizational)
   - ‚úÖ Values alignment mentioned

**Maximum exchanges before draft: 3** (not 5-7)
```

## Comparison: Old vs New

| Aspect | Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Questions Asked** | 4-6 separate questions | 1 context-rich question + 1-2 follow-ups |
| **Exchanges Required** | 5-7 exchanges | 2-3 exchanges maximum |
| **Context Usage** | Mentioned but not integrated | Directly incorporated in questions |
| **Draft Trigger** | Vague "maturity assessment" | Clear criteria checklist |
| **User Time** | 8-12 minutes | 3-5 minutes |
| **User Fatigue** | High (too many questions) | Low (concise, targeted) |
