## Current Project Status & Demo

Great news! I'm excited to share that we've successfully launched the **Strength Discovery through Stories** module - our first major milestone. 

**🚀 Live Demo:** https://lifecraft-bot.vercel.app

This represents approximately **40% of our planned system** and demonstrates:
- AI-powered Socratic questioning methodology based on Hope-Action Theory
- Stage-based conversation flow (Initial → Exploration → Deepening → Analysis → Summary)
- Real-time strength analysis using GPT-4o
- Interactive mindmap visualization of personal strengths
- Natural language processing for strength categorization

**Please spend 15-20 minutes testing this before our meeting** - your technical insights will be invaluable for planning the next phases.
