## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### New AI Service Architecture
```typescript
// Enhanced service selection with fallback
export class AIServiceManager {
  async generateResponse(messages: Message[]): Promise<AIResponse> {
    try {
      // Primary: Claude 3 Haiku (cost-effective)
      return await this.claudeService.chat(messages);
    } catch (error) {
      // Fallback: OpenAI GPT-4 (reliable)
      return await this.openAIService.chat(messages);
    }
  }
}
```

### Interactive Chart System
```typescript
// Chart.js with zoom capabilities
const chartOptions = {
  plugins: {
    zoom: {
      zoom: { wheel: { enabled: true, modifierKey: 'ctrl' } },
      pan: { enabled: true, mode: 'y' }
    }
  },
  onHover: (event, elements) => showDeleteButton(elements)
};
```

### Response Validation Engine
```typescript
// Multi-layer validation system
interface ResponseValidation {
  isValid: boolean;
  reason: string;
  shouldRedirect: boolean;
  redirectMessage?: string;
}

validateUserResponse(message: string, stage: ConversationStage): ResponseValidation
```

## 📋 Upgrade Instructions

### Zero-Downtime Deployment
This release is **fully backward compatible**:

```bash
# Simple upgrade process
git checkout v2.0-release
npm install
npm run build  
npm start
```

### Environment Configuration
Add Claude API key for cost optimization:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_existing_openai_key  # Kept as fallback
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Visit `/api/health` to verify service status
2. ✅ Test conversation flow and new chart interactions
3. ✅ Confirm cost savings in API usage monitoring

---

## 🔍 Breaking Changes

### API Changes
- **Environment Variables**: Now requires either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Service Selection**: Automatic fallback logic replaces single-service configuration

### Component Interface Changes
- **Chart Components**: New props for zoom and interaction controls
- **Session Store**: Enhanced structure for real-time state management
