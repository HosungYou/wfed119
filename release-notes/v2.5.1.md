# Release Notes v2.5.1 - Stability & Localization Fixes

**Release Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Version**: 2.5.1  
**Type**: Patch Release

## ðŸ”§ Fixes & Improvements

- **Client Runtime Stability**: Prevented the browser bundle from loading Anthropic's server SDK by switching UI imports to `import type`. This removes the `Application error: a client-side exception` crash observed in production.
- **Value Discovery Copy Update**: Replaced lingering Korean labels with English equivalents and deepened the text tone to `text-gray-700`, improving readability against light backgrounds.

## ðŸ§ª QA Notes

- Smoke test the Value Discovery landing page to confirm the English copy renders and buttons remain functional.
- Launch the Strength Discovery module to verify the chat interface loads without client-side exceptions.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

Deploy via `npm run build` followed by the Render auto-deploy. No database migrations or environment variable changes are required.
