# Release Notes v2.5.1 - Stability & Localization Fixes

**Release Date**: September 17, 2025  
**Version**: 2.5.1  
**Type**: Patch Release

## ðŸ”§ Fixes & Improvements

- **Client Runtime Stability**: Guarded the Zustand session store against missing `localStorage` on the server, so the homepage no longer throws the `Application error: a client-side exception` banner.
- **AI Service Import Hygiene**: Prevented the browser bundle from pulling in Anthropic's server SDK by keeping UI imports as `import type` only.
- **Value Discovery Readability**: Replaced lingering Korean labels with English equivalents and deepened body text to `text-gray-700`.
- **Value Board Layout**: Drag-and-drop buckets now sit in a responsive grid (1â†’2â†’4 columns), keeping "Not Important" aligned on desktop while staying mobile friendly.

## ðŸ§ª QA Notes

- Smoke test the Value Discovery landing page to confirm the English copy renders and buttons remain functional.
- Launch the Strength Discovery module to verify the chat interface loads without client-side exceptions.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

Deploy via `npm run build` followed by the Render auto-deploy. No database migrations or environment variable changes are required.
