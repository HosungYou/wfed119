          Exploring Values: A Guide to Understanding Personal and Work Values
                                                                                  Hyung Joon Yoon
As we navigate through life, our values serve as the compass that guides our decisions,
behaviors, and aspirations. They shape our understanding of what is important,
influence our interactions, and lay the foundation for our sense of purpose. In this
exploration, we delve into the realms of Terminal Values, Instrumental Values, and
Work Values, each offering a unique perspective on what individuals may prioritize
and seek in life and in their careers.
Background
The exploration of values has a rich history in the field of psychology, with Dr. Milton
Rokeach being a pioneering figure through his development of the Rokeach Value
Survey. This survey originally identified a set of 18 Terminal Values, reflecting
desirable end-states of existence, and 18 Instrumental Values, representing preferable
modes of behavior. Furthermore, an understanding of Work Values helps illuminate
what individuals seek in their professional environments.
Strengthening the Framework
In our journey today, we present an enriched and tailored version of these value sets.
The goal is to resonate more closely with the diverse aspirations and priorities of
individuals in today’s multifaceted and interconnected world. We have expanded and
refined the original lists, introducing additional values and providing clearer
descriptions, thus ensuring a comprehensive and relevant exploration of what guides
us.
Terminal Values
These values represent the goals individuals would like to achieve during their
lifetime. They are the desirable end-states that give direction to our lives.

Activity Overview
To delve deeper, we will engage in an activity where you will explore and reflect upon
these values. Using a 4-point scale (Very Important, Important, Somewhat Important,
and Not Important), you will sort through each value based on its importance to you,
either online or offline, through a card sort format. This reflection aims to provide
insights into your unique value system and encourage thoughtful consideration of how
these values influence your life and career aspirations.
   •   Very Important: This value is fundamental and deeply influences your behavior and
       decisions, both personally and professionally.
   •   Important: This value has a significant impact on your actions and choices in both
       spheres, but is not as foundational as those marked "Very Important".
   •   Somewhat Important: This value holds some influence but is less prioritized compared
       to those marked "Important" or "Very Important".
   •   Not Important: This value has minimal or no influence on your decisions and actions.
Let’s embark on this journey of self-discovery and reflection, exploring the myriad values that
shape our lives and the world around us. Remember, this survey is about gauging the importance
of each value to you, not about how well you feel you achieve or exhibit them. There are no right
or wrong answers; your individual perspective is what matters. Happy exploring!
